## Network Improvments

Short Term: Break each connction into two threads, one that just does recv and
one that does resp_parser and reply stuff

Update: Short term was a massive failure.
Goals: Split it along resp_parser / doing work instead of recv / everything else

Long Term: "Connection Groups" with `poll` / `select` for IO

## Type system

Make it better / real

## Commands

Add deletion

## Tricks

For things that are normally small but also can be big, allocate a stack
variable, then fall back to malloc if you really need to.

Just made those changed in connhandler, but if you could also fix resp-array
parsing that'd be a big good fix I think. Bulkstrings as an added bonus but
not vital. That is 3 chonkin malloc calls. Actually maybe not all bulkstrings,
cuz some are stored into the hashtable. Think about it.

UPDATE: Replace all the stack stuff with Buffer Stretching in which we simply
realloc if it's too small, thus eliminating all the mallocs
