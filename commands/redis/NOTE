All the code in this directory is copied directly from redis.

I'm not a lawyer, but from my laypersons understanding, since the
code I'm copying is a) small b) fairly generic and c) part of an
entirely new codebase (so transformative use) it should be fair use.
However, if any redis maintainer wants to reach out please do and
I'll go though and remove all this code and write my own implementations
as soon as I can.
